# Autonomous-Underwater-Vehicle-Control-using-Reinforcement-Learning

This is a course project which was done by my partner and I. The entire code to train the RL agent has been written by me. Feel free to adapt it to your need.

The project:

A Deep Actor-Critic based framework has been implemented to train the agent which is used to navigate an AUV through user specified way-points.

The aim is to train the agent, and then simulate and test the learned behaviour in UnderWater Simulator UWSim (http://www.irs.uji.es/uwsim/)

The project uses the Stable-Baselines library to train the agent. The environment file of the project has been written in accordance with the Stable Baselines' guidelines and also takes into account the underwater ocean dynamics (borrowed from UWSim).

For more details about the project and implementation, refer the project report AUV_RL.pdf.
